				Privacy Policy
Last updated: December 10, 2016

This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the website owned and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Site”). By providing Personally Identifiable Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

<h3>1. What Types of Information Does YazamTec Collect From Me?</h3>
<br>
We gather two basic types of information through the Site: “Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII“) and “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” (or “Non-PII“) Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, postal address, telephone number or email address. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal a person’s specific identity.

Personally Identifiable Information. You do not have to provide PII through the Site. However, in order to participate in various opportunities provided through the Site (for example, when you make a request regarding our products or services), we may request that you provide PII.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you use the Site, YazamTec and its third-party service providers may collect Non-PII. Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from any of the following sources: your browser; server log files; cookies; pixel tags and other similar technologies; and information that you voluntarily provide. We note that YazamTec may aggregate PII in a manner that does not personally identify you, and this aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy because it does not personally identify any user.
</br>
<h3>2. How Does YazamTec Use and Disclose Information Collected From Me?</h3>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information. We may use PII: (i) to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to notify you of product releases or to send newsletters to you; (ii) to send to you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information; (iii) to send to you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you; (iv) for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns; (v) to personalize your experience on the Site by presenting products and offers tailored to you; and (vi) as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate.

Your PII may be disclosed: (a) to our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, IT services, customer service, email delivery services, auditing services and other similar services to enable them to provide services; (b) to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings); and (c) as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose your PII to others as we believe to be appropriate: (i) under applicable law; (ii) to comply with legal process and respond to requests from public and governmental authorities; (iii) to enforce the “Terms of Use” below; and (iv) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, or those of you or others.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-PII for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your geographical location with your email address). If we combine any Non-II with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is combined.
</br>
<h3>3. Other Important Notes Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</h3>
<br>
Choices and Access. We give you a choice regarding our use and disclosure of your PII for marketing purposes. If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by sending us an email at Parking Finder@YazamTec.com. In addition, if you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, delete or otherwise limit our use of your PII that has been previously provided to us, you may contact us by sending us an email at Parking Finder@YazamTec.com. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.

Third Party Sites. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.

Security. We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect PII under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Use of Site by Minors. The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that these individuals do not provide PII through the Site.

Updates to this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please take a look at the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

Jurisdiction. The Site is controlled and operated by us from the United States, and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.

Contacting Us. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at Parking Finder@YazamTec.com or please write to the following address: 393 Vintage Park Drive, Suite 140, Foster City, CA 94404. Please note that email communications are not always secure; so please do not include sensitive information in your emails to us.
